# About

The Secure Device Onboard All-In-One demo is designed to run different Secure Device Onboard
services like Manufacturer, IoT Platform SDK Service and Rendezvous Service from a single
**docker** instance. The purpose of this demo is to fast-track demonstration of Secure
Device Onboard protocol using different client implementations.

***NOTE***: The All-In-One demo is provided solely to demonstrate out-of-box operation of Secure Device Onboard components. _This demo is not recommended for use in any production capacity._Â  Appropriate security measures with respect to key-store management and configuration management should be considered while performing production deployment of any Secure Device Onboard component.

# Directory structure

The all-in-one-demo repository is structured into following 2 folders.
* `services` : The implementation for All-In-One demo services, which includes messages redirection
  as well automatic extension of vouchers and scheduling TO0 requests for them.

* `container` : The packaging of the demo is managed here. The overlay folder contains the
  configuration and data files that needs to be copied to final demo package.

# Building the SDO All-In-One Demo

The All-In-One demo is dependent on following repositories.

* `pri` : https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/pri

* `iot-platform-sdk` : https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/iot-platform-sdk

* `supply-chain-tools` : https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/supply-chain-tools

* `rendezvous-service` : https://github.com/secure-device-onboard/rendezvous-service

These repositories should be built using 'mvn clean install' command on the host machine before
building all-in-one-demo repository using following command.

```
mvn clean install
```

Alternatively, you have to option to build All-in-One demo using Docker.[Read more](build/README.md)

```
cd build/
docker-compose up --build
```

After successful build, the demo package is available at demo/aio.tar.gz.
